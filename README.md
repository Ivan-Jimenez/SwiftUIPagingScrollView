# SwiftUIPagingScrollView
implementation of generic paging scrollView in SwiftUI since there is not such option with SwiftUI ScrollView implementation

![Example](https://github.com/izakpavel/SwiftUIPagingScrollView/blob/master/exampleRotation.gif)

This is still WIP but so far demonstrates the idea of using Hstack as a container and modifing the items offset based on the drag gesture

* tested with XCode 11 beta 7

**Recent changes:**
* Buttons can be now embedded into scrollview
* Prepared binding to get active page index
* taking dragging velicoty into account - fast scrolling is more fluid

**Todo:**
* cleaner interface
